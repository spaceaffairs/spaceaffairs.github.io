                <hi> Aim: </h1>
                <p> This section is primarily a collection of references we have come across that address relations between (mathematical) thought, movement and/or space. We am currently working on deepening our understanding of the fields, and hope to have more to say about them soon. 
                <p> The language of both mathematics and dance are highly speciliazed. Figuring out how to communicate ideas coming from one field to the other is a prerequisite to think across the disciplines. We hope this site will be a first step in this direction. 
                <p> Do not hesitate to contact us should you have share our interest or wish to contribute something!

                    In chapter 4 of &#34;Figuring Space: Philosophy, Mathematics and Physics&#34;, Gilles Ch&acirc;telet goes back to the seminal hours of linear algebra in the work of the 19th century geometer Hermann Gra&szlig;mann.
                    Ch&acirc;telet's idea of constructing extension involves starting with an intensive magnitude without extension and a virtual or potential process for separating the parts of an intensive magnitude across virtual moments of time or space. In particular, any line is always the product of a moving point.
                    <p> It follows that our capacity to conceptualize things in space presupposes the <i> action of moving through space </i>, thereby generating it.

                    <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0927-0" target="_blank"> Sheaves in Geometry and Logic </a> by Moedrijk and McLane gives deep insights into the relationship between space and logic.
                    <p> Mathematical objects called sheaves arose in both geometry (as descriptions of the functions appropriate to various kinds of spaces) and logic (as carriers for models of set theory). 
                    <p> This text presents topos theory as it has developed from the study of sheaves. Beginning with several examples, it explains the underlying ideas of topology and sheaf theory as well as the general theory of elementary toposes and geometric morphisms and their relation to logic. 
                    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram"> Venn diagrams </a> are a well known example of a spatial representation of the interplay of logic and set theory.

                    <h2> <center> Improvisation technologies </enter></h2>
                    <a href="http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/improvisation-technologies/" target="_blank"> Improvisation technologies </a> is an introduction into the choreographer William Forsythe's way of conceptualizing movement. Together with members of his company, he explains the key principles of his improvisation work in over 100 video chapters in the form of short lectures. The video recordings were created graphically: animated white lines and other effects delineate sequences of movement and figures. Physical movement and its relationship with space can thus be perceived in a quite different way.
                    <p> Besides shifting the work of the dancer from reproducing forms to performing (spatio-temporal) operations on choreographic material defined as a set of relations, William Forsythe introduces the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation" target="_blank"> equivalence relation</a> in dance.
                    <p> A &#39;rond de jambe&#39;, for example, is a particular instance of the action of drawing a circle. So, modulo the body part and orientation is space, turning ones head to look back <i> is </i> a rond de jambe.  
                    <h2> <center> Rudolf von Laban </enter></h2>
                    In opposition to Ballet, which he perceived as a stagnating form, Rudolf von Laban defines dance as an expression of lived experience (<i>seelisches erleben</i>) which in turn he analyses using spatial models derived from mathematics (e.g. Euclidian space, icosaeder).
